	h1.h--primary Rules At VPDB

	p VPDB is a very young platform. Weâ€™re counting on each member to exercise common sense: Treat others with respect as you would in real life. If that's not enough, we will start updating this rule sheet with more explicit points.

	h3 Upload Policy
	p See the <a ui-sref="faq">FAQ</a> for more information about who can upload content and how the moderation works. Here are a few rules that should help improving the chance of your content being approved:

	ul
		li Only upload content created by yourself.
		li If you get permission from an author to upload his or her creations, let us know beforehand so we can confirm. When uploading, make sure you set the correct author.
		li If your release is a mod of another release, be sure to put the URL of the original release somewhere in the description. If the original release it not on VPDB, use the site where it was first released. (Note: This is for during the beta, the final version will support a way of indicating this in a structured way.)
		li If your release is a mod of another release that only allows authorized mods, give us contact details of the original author in the moderation section so we confirm your claims.

	h3 Changes
	p Should we change the rules, we will announce changes on the website.
