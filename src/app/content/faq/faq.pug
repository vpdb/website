	h1.h--primary Frequently Asked Questions

	h3.h--multiline.h--smaller What's the difference between releases and games?
	p Games at VPDB are independent from digital recreations. They just contain information and media about the physical (real world) game. Releases, on the other hand, are digital versions of a given game which are playable on your computer. There can be multiple releases per game, e.g., from different authors or with different features. You can see a game as metadata for all recreations of that game.

	h3.h--multiline.h--smaller What are "flavors"?
	p Due to past limitations, Visual Pinball tables have often been redistributed for different setups. For example, a table might have been released as a desktop table, designed for landscape monitors. Soon a "fullscreen" version of the same table would follow, allowing it to play on portrait-oriented screens found in virtual cabinets. Often, people would mod these releases and re-release them as “night” or “day” mods.
	p Flavors define for which setup a file is designed. When uploading a table file, the author needs to indicate the file's "flavor", i.e. orientation, lighting and also with which version(s) of Visual Pinball it is compatible. A release can contain multiple files covering multiple flavors. This makes it easy to filter by orientation, lighting and compatibility to the user's preference.
	p We acknowledge that with Visual Pinball X, a single file can be used for any lighting or orientation. Hence, both attributes can be set to "universal", in which case the file will show up for any filters might applied.

	h3.h--multiline.h--smaller Then what are tags for?
	p Tags are a simple way to mark common features of a release independently of its flavor. It's either set or not. Examples are "3D", which indicates that a release is entirely made out of 3D objects (as opposed to 2D sprites), "HD" for releases with textures high enough to render crispy on full HD monitors, and so on. Tags can be created by table authors.

	h3.h--multiline.h--smaller Where does the content at VPDB come from?
	p Media and ROMs are provided by the VPDB. All other content is uploaded by the respective authors directly. We don't host content that hasn't explicitly been approved by the respective authors.

	h3.h--multiline.h--smaller So anyone can upload content to VPDB?
	p Yes, but content from not established contributors goes through a manual approval process before it's published on the site.

	h3.h--multiline.h--smaller How does the approval process work?
	p At VPDB, every element of an uploaded vpt/vpx file is indexed with a checksum. Before a release gets published, the moderator can see how many elements of that release are equal to other releases. It basically shows a similarity rating about the upload in question. This allows to instantly identify mods across the VPDB database. If the original table has no general mod permission, we will start asking questions before publishing.

	h3.h--multiline.h--smaller Why can't I create new games?
	p While anyone can upload releases, the game metadata is maintained by the VPDB staff. This is in order to assure maximum quality of data and media provided for the games. We've added a lot of games already but if you have content for a missing game you can request that game to be added.

	h3.h--multiline.h--smaller Why is the quality so crappy when previewing full screen media like backglasses or playfield shots?
	p The full-res previews are encoded with a high compression ratio. The full quality version can be obtained by clicking on the <i>Download</i> button.

	h3.h--multiline.h--smaller Why can't I upload flyers, instructions, videos or other game media?
	p We're still in beta and the media part is still under development. When finished, VPDB will support any kind of media.

	h3.h--multiline.h--smaller Does VPDB support Future Pinball?
	p We currently only support vpt/vpx files for Visual Pinball. However, our data structure is flexible enough so that we could add additional platforms in the future.

	h3.h--multiline.h--smaller What happens if I log in through another provider? Does VPDB see my password?
	p No. For example, you log in with Google, VPDB sends you to Google along with a code that identifies you as coming from VPDB. Should you agree to share your email address with VPDB, Google will redirect you back to VPDB with an access token, which is a random number. With that token, VPDB can retrieve your email address from Google and authenticate you.

	h3.h--multiline.h--smaller So if I previously logged with Google and Google closes my account, I cannot log in to VPDB anymore?
	p That's correct. However, while you're logged at VPDB, you can at any time create local credentials that allow you to log in directly to VPDB.

	h3.h--multiline.h--smaller How safe is my uploaded content in case of an accident/hack/tornado?
	p Our database replicates data in real-time to two additional off-site servers. Uploaded files are backed up every 10 minutes. There are multiple admins who have full access to the server in case of an emergency. We've put an enormous effort in creating VPDB and it's a project that will be available and maintained for a long time to come.

	h3.h--multiline.h--smaller Why aren't there more releases available?
	p VPDB is a very young platform and for contributors to upload content, trust must be built. This doesn't happen overnight, especially in a community like this, which is wonderful but nonetheless had its fair share of drama. However, by playing by the rules, respecting the people and the industry and staying a friendly place, we hope to establish that trust and to continue growing.
